		In this experiment, we are interested in how people predict the price fluctuation of a stock based on its past performance. The experiment will take you around 20 minutes. We ask that you complete the experiment in one sitting. Please do not switch away from the screen during this time. You will be paid $1 for your time, and a bonus of up to $1.50 based on your performance on the task.</p>

		<p class="block-text"> Thank you for accepting this HIT. This experiment has three parts. In the the first part, you will play the role of an analyst of a stock brokerage firm. </p>

		<p class ="block-text"> You have been assigned to follow the stock of the company "Enigma Inc.". Your job is to predict if the price of the stock will go UP or DOWN.</p>

		<p class="block-text"> In each time period, you will see a screen like this: </p>

		<p class = "logo"><img src = "images/logo1.png"></img></p>

		<div class = "choice_pos"><div class = "left"> UP</div><div class = "right"> DOWN</div></div>

		<p class="block-text"> If you think the stock will go UP in the next time period, press "Z" on your keyboard.</p> 

		<p id='logo-text'>(Try it! Press Z to advance to the next page)</p>

		<p class="block-text"> If you guess correctly, you will win 4 cents. If you guess wrongly, you will lose 4 cents. This money will be a performance bonus on top of the $1 you will receive for this experiment. Try to earn as much extra money as possible.</p> 

		<p class='block-text'>Tips: When the price of a stock is going up, it tends to keep going up (but not always) </p>

		<p class='block-text'> When the price of a stock is going down, it tends to keep going down (but not always) </p>

		<p class='block-text'> The likelihood that the price will go up or down changes from time to time. You will have to figure this out by tracking the stock's performance over time.</p>
